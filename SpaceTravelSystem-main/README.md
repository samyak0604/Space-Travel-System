# Space Travel System

Welcome to the future Space Travelling System!

This is a travelling system made using OOPS in C++.

 Choose your role among Passenger, Astronaut or Commander. Each user has different options to chose from, with Commander havind overall authority.

It is an interactive program to help with booking, viewing or deleting your travel tickets. A ticket can be booked at most 10 years in advance.

A Space Travel is confirmed only when more than 2 passengers, an astronaut and a commander are available for the journey.

There are currently 13 Passengers (ID 1 - 13), 2 Astronauts (ID 14 - 15) and 2 Commanders (ID 16-17)

## Usage

To run this program you need a ``GCC Compiler`` installed in your local machine.

Run ``g++ -o spacetravel SpaceTravelSystem.cpp stsclasses.cpp`` on your terminal to build the binary executable file.

Then run ``./spacetravel`` to start the program in your Command-Line Interfac (CLI).
